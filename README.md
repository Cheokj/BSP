# Boosting Stability and Plasticity in Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation
This is the implementation of BSP (Boosting Stability and Plasticity in Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation). (This repository is building....)

Our code framework is designed following the structure of Universal Model (MIA-2024) (https://github.com/ljwztc/CLIP-Driven-Universal-Model) for medical imaging experiment and CoinSeg (ICCV-2023) (https://github.com/zkzhang98/CoinSeg) for natural imaging experiment.
